Then after add the head tag which is where you will store the meta data, the title whcich displays on the webpage tab, and also style sheet link. </li>

          <ul>
            <li>Javascript is a programming lanugage used to create interactivity to the webpage</li>
            <li>You will link javascript to html by placing it below the footer but above the body element. The link must be placed after css link for proper preesentation while loading the webpage.</li>
            <li>To create a javasript file it must be say script.js</li>
            <li>You must always use a declaration in front of a variable a common declaration is Let.</li>
            <li>Next after youve set the declaration next, remeber that a variable is what the data will be stored in... think of the variable being a box and the data after assignement operator which is the equal sign will be stored in that variable. That value must also be enclosed with single or double quatations if it is a string.</li>
            <li>After we have set declaration and stored our data into a variable i will then go ahead and create a console log so that way the message can output onto the webpage console log. This occurs by creating an argument</li>
            <li>To create an arugument you will use the console.log method which allows you to use console.log parathensis with the variable name inside paraenthsis causing those values to come on  to the webpage console log.</li>
            <li>In order to see what was logged into the websites webpage inspect you must open the chrome dev tool by using cmd+option+I or by right clicking on the webpage and clicking inspect in menu. You  will then see it at the bottom of the console tab. If you want to see the full code click on global code.</li>
