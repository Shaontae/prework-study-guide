        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Html is the foundation of a webpage it builds the pages structure and provides basic frame work and contenton a webpage.</li>
          <li>We use opening and closing tags and elemnets to build the html page. Elements can be used to divide content as well such as meta related elements, content division element, semantic element.</li>
          <li>To set up the html page you must  first add the declaration for html which is !Doctype html. Under the declartion add the html tag also add lang attribute. Then after add the head tag which is where you will store the meta data, the title whcich displays on the webpage tab, and also style sheet link. </li>
          <li>After add the body anything in between the body tags will be displayed on the live webapge.YOU MUST ALSO ADD THE JAVASCRIPT LINK TO THE BODY IN ORDER FOR THE CONSOLE TO LOG IT INTO THE WEBPAGE</li>
          <LI></LI>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. </li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Css works on building aesthitics, and design to webpage. Its useed by developers to define how webpage is presented to users.</li>
          <li>css defines colors aesthetics, visual layout, organization.</li>
          <li>Most effective way to use css is by the external style sheet cause it also you to create a seperarte sheet to put css content in making your code easier to understand and gives orgainzation.</li>
          <li>to use external css stylesheet you must use the css style sheet link should be in head tag but above the title</li>
          <li>Margin indicates space outside of the element</li>
          <li>padding indicates the space inside an element</li>
          <li>when you want to use selcetors with same css styles values itts besst to group them using the comma to seperate the selectors. This prevents repeating the same css code keeping file organized.</li>
          <li>class is identified with a .________ while id is identified with a #_____ if youre sharing elelments group them by using comma to seperate the two</li>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Javascript is a programming lanugage used to create interactivity to the webpage</li>
            <li>You will link javascript to html by placing it below the footer but above the body element. The link must be placed after css link for proper preesentation while loading the webpage.</li>
            <li>To create a javasript file it must be say script.js</li>
            <li>You must always use a declaration in front of a variable a common declaration is Let.</li>
            <li>Next after youve set the declaration next, remeber that a variable is what the data will be stored in... think of the variable being a box and the data after assignement operator which is the equal sign will be stored in that variable. That value must also be enclosed with single or double quatations if it is a string.</li>
            <li>After we have set declaration and stored our data into a variable i will then go ahead and create a console log so that way the message can output onto the webpage console log. This occurs by creating an argument</li>
            <li>To create an arugument you will use the console.log method which allows you to use console.log parathensis with the variable name inside paraenthsis causing those values to come on  to the webpage console log.</li>
            <li>In order to see what was logged into the websites webpage inspect you must open the chrome dev tool by using cmd+option+I or by right clicking on the webpage and clicking inspect in menu. You  will then see it at the bottom of the console tab. If you want to see the full code click on global code.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Control flow = the order in which a computer excecutes code in a script. It reads first statement top to bottom thas why is important to write your code in the order you wish the order to go in.</li>
            <li>Conditional statements and loops interrupts the control flow. These methods only work if a condition is met.</li>
            <strong><li>1. The if ... else conditional statement method - Code will excecute only if a condition is met</li></strong>
            <li>The computer will check for if statementes if the condition is truthy it will exceucte if it is falsy javascript will skip over it. <strong>IF ELSE STATEMENTS ARE VERY USEFUL SO GET FAMAILAIR WITH LETS YOU HAVE MORE CONTROL OF TELLING YOUR COMPUTER WHAT TO DO.</strong></li>
            <li>After you have <strong>created your variable and stored data</strong> and used the <strong>console.log method</strong> to send output messages youre using javascript tthe correct way. Then by adding the <strong>if..else method</strong> you are interrupting the control flow which is needed in order to ttell computer to excecute a js only if a condition is met. </li>
            <li>the if else statement method is ok to use when you have a few condition butt what if you had hundreads? you will have then go ahead and use the <strong>Arrays method</strong> which is another way of interrupting conttrol flow </li>
            <li><strong>ITS BEST TO USE THE IF ELSE STATMENTS ONLY FOR SMALL CONDITIONS NEEDED TO BE MET |||| USE ARRAYS METHOD WHEN EVALUATING MULTIPLE VALUES AT ONCE</strong></li>

            <li> An array is a single vairable thats used to hold a group of related datta. an array is created the same way as creating a variable for a one data storage. In this case you will use the "s" at the end of vaiable name to indicate its a group (ex. var shape vs var shapes)</li>
            <li>In an array you will write the order in which you want the computer to excecute code. This is because we have location spots for the sequence order of the data liste in the parathenisis. These numbers are called index. </li>
            <li>The index rule... 0,1,2,3,4 .... and so on. Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array. The first of index number is always 0 never 1.</li>
            <li>To see the array in action you will go ahead and log it into thee console.log ex console.log(shapes[0]); </li>
            <li>you can also add strings, numbers, and booleans in arrays as well Although arrays method will work forr logging multiplee values for some cases itts not thee most effeicent. The best way to log multiple values at once is by using the for loop method.</li>

          <h2>For Loops Method</h2>

          <li><strong><center>Most effeicent way of mutlipying mupltiple values at once(Javascript)</center></strong></li>
          <li>A for loop usees predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items   in an array by allowing a single code block to be eexcucuted over and over.(The control flow must always be interrupted to complete this method. Use the if conditional statements to do so)</li>
          <li>In other words I can tell the computer to look through each value in an array and then im able to log them into the console using a single block till theres no more values left.</li>
          <li>To use the for loops method you would need to know the array index(location number) and the array length (found using length property in vs) of a statement.</li>
          <li>Length is needed to know so that computer knows how many times to run till there isnt any more values left. To create a </li>
